o move code from a feature branch to a release branch in Bitbucket, following your company's workflow where new code is developed on a feature branch, merged into the develop branch through a pull request, and eventually merged into a release branch for production, you can follow these detailed steps:

Step 1: Merge Feature Branch into Develop
Push Your Feature Branch: Ensure your feature branch is up to date and pushed to the remote repository on Bitbucket.
git push origin feature-branch-name
Create a Pull Request (PR) to Develop:
Go to your repository in Bitbucket.
Click on Pull requests > Create pull request.
Set the Source branch to your feature-branch-name and the Destination branch to develop.
Fill in the PR details: title, description (what changes are being introduced, and why), and assign reviewers.
Click Create pull request.
Review and Merge the PR:
Once the PR is reviewed and approved by your team, and all automated checks pass, click on Merge to merge the changes into the develop branch.
Step 2: Prepare the Release Branch
If the release branch for the upcoming production release does not already exist:

Create the Release Branch from Develop:
Optionally, pull the latest changes from develop to your local machine:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
Create the release branch:
git checkout -b release/x.y.z (replace x.y.z with your release version)
git push origin release/x.y.z
If the release branch already exists and you're adding more changes to it:

Ensure the Release Branch is Updated: Before merging new changes, make sure the release branch has the latest updates that are ready for production.
Step 3: Merge Develop into Release (if applicable)
If additional changes from develop need to be included in the release after the release branch has been created:

Create a Pull Request from Develop to Release:
Go to Pull requests > Create pull request in Bitbucket.
Set the Source branch to develop and the Destination branch to your release/x.y.z branch.
Fill in the PR details and assign reviewers.
Click Create pull request.
Review and Merge the PR:
After review and once all checks pass, merge the PR into the release branch.
Step 4: Final Testing and Fixes
Test the Release Branch: Conduct final testing within the release branch. Make any required fixes directly in this branch.
Merge Fixes Back to Develop: If fixes are made in the release branch, ensure they are also merged back into develop to keep the branches in sync.
Step 5: Release
Merge Release to Master/Main for Deployment: Follow your company's procedure for deploying the release, which may involve merging the release branch into master or main and tagging the release.
Additional Considerations
Communicate with Your Team: Keep your team informed about the PRs you're creating and merging, especially when it involves critical branches like develop and release.
Follow Project Guidelines: Adhere to your company's specific guidelines for naming conventions, review processes, and deployment procedures.
