I successfully managed 10 repositories, enhancing the code coverage significantly by adding 40-50 unit test cases. My learning extended to the React library and Spring Boot Framework, aiding in troubleshooting and improving the Camp dashboard. Additionally, I actively participated in the build and release processes, and played a key role in FARM Break remediation and client engagement, especially in supporting CAMP SRE testing and effectively responding to operational team queries. My collaboration with the team was evident in my involvement in recruitment, training, and agile methodologies, showcasing my comprehensive contribution to the team's progress and efficiency.


In my role this year, I've really dived deep into learning the ins and outs of the CAMP bank loan process and have gotten my hands dirty with multiple development tools and MSSQL. It's been a journey of growth - from poring over 10 different repositories to improve our code coverage with over 40 unit tests, to wrapping my head around the React library and Spring Boot Framework. This wasn't just about ticking boxes; it was about making our Camp dashboard better and being that go-to person when our team hit a snag.

I also stepped into the build and release arena, getting a real taste of what it means to keep our processes smooth and efficient. Handling FARM Break remediation wasn't just a task, it felt like solving a complex puzzle that kept our infrastructure strong. On the human side of things, I found myself in the thick of team dynamics - from helping pick the right candidates to join us, to making sure we all stayed on track with our training and agile practices. It's been a year where I've not just grown my skills, but also felt a deeper connection with the team and our goals.
